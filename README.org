* Introduction

A complete rewrite of my personal Emacs configuration, using literate
programming and org-mode. This file is inspired by configuration files of [[https://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html][Sacha Chua]],
[[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org][Mathieu Marques]], [[https://jamiecollinson.com/blog/my-emacs-config/][Jamie Collinson]], [[https://github.com/protesilaos][Protesilaos Stavrou]], [[https://howardabrams.com/hamacs][Howard Abrams]], [[https://github.com/rougier/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org][Nicolas
Rougier]] and [[https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d][minimal-emacs.d]].

I'm running Emacs on Macosx and on Windows. I tried to make this
configuration compatible with both environment.

* How to use

Open =dotemacs.org= with Emacs and tangle code using 'C-c C-v t' to initialize
=~/.emacs.d/early-init.el= and =~/.emacs.d/init.el=. If these files already
exists, they will be overwritten.

* Personal settings

Personal settings can be load from =.work/settings.el= or =.home/settings.el= if
it exist in user Emacs directory.

* Notes

On windows, Emacs is looking for =init.el= in user's home directory in
=AppData\Roaming= folder. To bypass this behavior, set =HOME= environment
variable to a different path.
